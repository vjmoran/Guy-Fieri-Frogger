# Guy-Fieri-Frogger
My game is a modified version of Frogger, but instead of a frog, the character you control is Guy Fieri, and instead of catching flies, the goal is to get the ingredients to make a burger. The objective is to make it across the cars without getting hit and jump across the logs without falling into the water in order to retrieve an ingredient. 
If you are able to get the bun, burger, tomato, and onion with three lives, you will have successfully made a burger. 
Use the “up”, “down”, “left”, and “right” keys to control the movement of Guy Fieri in order to avoid the cars and the water. 
Each ingredient will show up once you have reached the last row of logs. When the ingredient appears, move up in order to retrieve the ingredient, which will automatically reset Guy’s position. 
Therefore, you must make it through the obstacles a total of 4 times with only 3 lives in order to obtain all 4 ingredients and make a mega burger. Good luck!
